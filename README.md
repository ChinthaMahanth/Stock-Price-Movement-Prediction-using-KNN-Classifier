# Stock-Price-Movement-Prediction-using-KNN-Classifier
This project applies machine learning to financial market data by using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict daily stock price movements. Historical stock data was retrieved via the yfinance API and enriched with engineered features including Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Bollinger Bands, and volatility measures. These features capture both short-term momentum and broader market trends, providing a richer representation of the underlying dynamics.

The dataset was preprocessed with normalization and split into training and testing sets, followed by hyperparameter tuning to optimize KNN performance. On a test set of ~250 trading days, the model achieved 67% prediction accuracy, demonstrating promising results for a simple non-parametric classifier. Evaluation included metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix, offering insights into classification performance. This project serves as a foundation for experimenting with more advanced machine learning models and showcases how financial indicators can be leveraged in predictive modeling.
